                    PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page. It is a server side scripting language which is used to creating dynamic webpage. PHP is open source, which means you do not have to pay for its licensing and hosting. No wonder that the number of websites using PHP development has increased exponentially over the past few years.</p>
